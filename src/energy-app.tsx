                    Goal
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The goal of this project is to analyze energy usage trends in the United States across a 50-year period, focusing on the rise of renewable energy, state-level energy pricing, and the geographic and environmental factors affecting energy consumption. The objective is to develop visual and interactive tools to inform environmentalists, students, researchers, and policymakers on how energy is being produced and consumed across the country.

                <h4>
                    Findings
                </h4>
                <p>
                    A major takeaway from this project is that a concerning amount of energy is still being generated by fossil fuels, especially coal. Despite frequent messaging from media and industry suggesting progress toward clean energy, renewable sources still represent a very small fraction of total energy production.
