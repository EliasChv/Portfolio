                    Goal
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The goal of the project was to build a fully functional Blackjack game using Godot and C#. The project focused on:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        Implementing classic Blackjack mechanics (player and dealer actions, betting, win/loss conditions).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Designing a responsive and intuitive user interface for a smooth gaming experience.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Incorporating betting and balance systems to allow for a more immersive and customizable experience.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Game Overview
                </h4>
                <p>
Player Needs: A traditional Blackjack experience with a user-friendly interface, clear feedback on the game status (win, loss, tie), the ability to place bets, and a system that tracks balance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Explicit Features:
                    <ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
Betting System: Players can place bets before each round, with their balance updated accordingly based on the outcome (win/loss).
                            </li>
                            <li>
Game Outcome Feedback: The game notifies the player if they win, lose, or tie, and prompts them to either retry the round or return to the main menu.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
Balance Tracking: Displays the player’s current balance and allows for continued play based on available funds.
                            </li>
                             <li>
Intuitive UI: The layout includes a clear representation of cards for both the player and the dealer, along with buttons for actions (hit, stand, etc.).
                            </li>
                            <li>
Retry or Main Menu Option: After each round, players can either try again or return to the main menu.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Conclusions
                </h4>
                <p>
This project demonstrated, full integration of game logic and user interface design using Godot’s scripting system. Effective use of object-oriented principles (e.g., Card and Deck classes) for handling gameplay mechanics. A responsive and scalable UI that dynamically adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility and a polished look. A fun, engaging game loop with clear feedback on player actions, winning or losing outcomes, and balanced decision-making.
